# Overview
ETHx is a multi pool architecture for node operations, designed for decentralization, scalability, and resilience. This design is integral to our ability to democratize node operations and adapt to increasing demand.
Our structure includes a permissionless pool, where anyone can participate and operate nodes, thereby fostering widespread participation. Alongside this, we also feature a permissioned pool. This is a select group of validators known for their consistent high performance.
